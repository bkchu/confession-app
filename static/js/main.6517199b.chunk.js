my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.\n          The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee; The city of the Lord, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.\n          Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.\n          Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.\n          For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.\n          Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.\n          The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.\n          Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.\n          Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.\n          A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the Lord will hasten it in his time.\n          (Isaiah 60:1-22)"}]}}}},N=n(52),B=n.n(N),x={Genesis:"gen",Exodus:"exo",Leviticus:"lev",Numbers:"num",Deuteronomy:"deu",Joshua:"jos",Judges:"jdg",Ruth:"rut","1 Samuel":"1sa","2 Samuel":"2sa","1 Kings":"1ki","2
